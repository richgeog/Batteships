The purpose is to create a game of Battleships using TTD and OOD. 
Our objective is to have a working game of battleships where the user is able to place their own ships in any chosen
location and direction on the board. The opponent does the same, and each player takes it in turn to attempt to hit 
each others ships. The first person to sink all of their opponents ships is the winner.
